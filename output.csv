"Global climate change could exacerbate certain of the threats facing our business, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events referred to in Performance of critical infrastructure in this section 9. In addition, increases in energy prices are partly influenced by government policies to address climate change which, combined with a growing data demand that increases our energy requirements, could increase our energy costs beyond our current expectations.",climate_sentiment,
"Our first £250-million, eight-year bond will mature in August 2025 with a return to investors of 1.625 per cent.

"Because our electric grid will continue to rely on high-voltage and lower-voltage power lines, we expect to invest about $800 million annually for the foreseeable future to build new transmission infrastructure, replace more than 2,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, and upgrade physical security at substations. The rebuilds will increase the capacity on our transmission lines, which in part enhances our ability to transport more renewable energy.",climate_sentiment,
"To better understand the landscape, Morgan Stanley engaged Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials and its current members in early 2020.

"Since 2016 we have also been working with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), using their mapping to identify parts of Australia with low rainfall and those areas more likely to experience rainfall variation. (Fig 1 - Rainfall Annual 30-year average (1986-2015)). When customers purchase properties in these areas, we test their financial resilience to climatic events like rainfall variation and drought. Customers with lower resilience may be subject to enhanced underwriting standards, for example, loan approval may be dependent on a lower loan to valuation ratio, higher repayments, or evidence of savings or equity. Our bankers also need to document the customer's knowledge of recent rainfall and climate trends where their farm is located and, if relevant, how they manage water budgets for irrigation.",climate_sentiment,
"Transportation infrastructure for electric mobility is the focus of IFC’s $8 million investment in Lithium, India’s first electric fleet operator company. The project will provide job opportunities for up to 8,000 drivers over five years. This is IFC’s inaugural investment in electric mobility. The project supports electrification of transportation, which will help avoid annual greenhouse emissions of more than 25,000 metric tons per year.",climate_sentiment,
"In addition to its efforts to develop sustainable products and services, the Bank has identified opportunities to be greener in its operations. The actions we have taken to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings have enabled us to currently exceed regulatory requirements and meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Over the past 20 years, the Bank has voluntarily adopted various measures to considerably improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated. This year, the Bank has set a target to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025. This science-based target aims to help limit global warming to 1.5 C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.",climate_sentiment,
"In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report, climate change poses an increasing threat to mankind and the global economy.

"There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. This new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Lastly, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.",climate_sentiment,
"Our current global economy’s linear business model of “take, make, and waste” is depleting natural resources faster than they can be replenished and straining ecosystems. Imagine repurposing a piece of plastic at the end of its use, giving it another life as something else. Its use is, in fact, circular, and the end of use doesn’t mean the end of life.",climate_sentiment,
"Climate change The EIB Group has ambitious targets to grow its support for climate action and environmental sustainability.

"2 Transition Risks. The electricity used in Fifth Third's facilities is generated from many generation sources in regulated and deregulated markets. If future legislation increases the cost of greenhouse gas emissions, the company could experience an increase in generation expenses from generators that use coal or natural gas. In 2017, Fifth Third signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to purchase as much power from a new solar project as the company uses in a year. While the primary reasons for this purchase were to demonstrate environmental leadership, a secondary beneft is that the company now has a long-term contract to buy carbon-free power. The project demonstrates our ability to lead on environmental sustainability while fnding ways to understand, control, and keep new risks within our risk appetite.",climate_sentiment,
