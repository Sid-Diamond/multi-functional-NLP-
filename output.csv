"2 intensity. The main upstream projects in progress, which account for about 45% of the total development investments in the sector in the four-year period 2019-22, show an overall break-even at a Brent price of $25/barrel, which is there- fore resilient even in the presence of a low-carbon scenario, and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 22%. Furthermore, these projects have a positive cumulative Free Cash Flow as early as 2019, due to the cash in from the application of the Dual Exploration Model, which is the early monetization of exploration suc- cesses through the sale of minority stakes. The hydrocarbon equity resources13 at 31/12/2018 show that natural gas, a bridge solution towards a low carbon future, accounts for over 50%. The flexibility and adaptability in the use of Eni's investments, amounting to about $33 billion in the period 2019-22, are confirmed by the non-committed share of 50% already in the two-years period 2021-22.",climate_sentiment,

"Climate change can pose material risks to sovereign debt due to its impact on national expenditures associated with disaster recovery from extreme weather events or preparedness through climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. Emerging market countries are particularly vulnerable since they often lack capital or have higher funding costs, which exacerbates the myriad risks that they already face. For example, many of these countries are vulnerable to food insecurity from both the impact of climate change on their own agricultural production and higher prices for imports. Our investment team members are increasingly focused on deepening their understanding of environmental risk in sovereigns and its complex links to fiscal and monetary conditions, which in turn affect bond yields and credit ratings.",climate_sentiment,
