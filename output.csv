"Initial insights The majority of the residential properties in our portfolio have a very low probability of experiencing damage from flooding or drought in the next 30 years. A relatively small number of properties, however, have a high probability of experiencing damage from flooding or drought in that period. Therefore, the impact on an individual household may be significant, even more so if the quality of the property is already low or the household’s response capacity is low (e.g. insufficient wealth or mortgage headroom). Nevertheless this initial analysis does not suggest a significant impact at either a portfolio or bank level.",climate_sentiment,,0,"[0.20207999646663666, 0.48392942547798157, 0.3139905631542206]","[1431467.25, 3480965.75, 3040920.5]",17,"low, flooding, damage, capacity, residential, relatively, level, insights, years, impact",
